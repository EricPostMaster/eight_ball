# Decision Fatigue Destroyer

My friends were moving to a new house, and they found themselves overwhelmed by important decisions, like what kind of fixtures to purchase or how to coordinate schedules with different contractors. They were also beset by minuscule, inconsequential decisions, like should I keep this pair of suspenders that I haven't worn in the last five years? moving to a new home is hard, so I made them this tool to help with decision, fatigue.
